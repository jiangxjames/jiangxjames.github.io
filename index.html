<h2>Brief Biography</h2>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in Industrial and Systems Engineering at University of Houston. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at in <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/orie/">Cornell ORIE</a>, hosted by <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/aslewis/">Adrian S. Lewis</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise">Lehigh ISE</a>, working with <a href="https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/frankecurtis/">Frank E. Curtis</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA, advised by <a href="http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/index.html">Lieven Vandenberghe</a>.</p>
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>I am broadly interested in the <b>mathematical foundations of data science</b>, with primary focuses on <b>theory and algorithms for large-scale optimization problems</b> from engineering and data science and <b>machine learning for graphical data</b>. My research interests broadly include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Convex and nonconvex optimization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Distributed (and decentralized) optimization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Artificial intelligence and scientific machine learning (especially on graphical data)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mathematical foundations of data science</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My research focuses on what I think of as &ldquo;practical theory&rdquo;, for example, designing algorithms that are both theoretically principled and effective for real-world problems. I'm especially drawn to ideas that are simple, intuitive, and&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;at least to me&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;elegant. Being a theoretician isn't about collecting theorems, just like being a writer isn't about stacking sentences. I work to understand core problems more deeply and explore when and why algorithms succeed or fail. As I continue to develop my research program, I'm excited to stay curious, learn from others, and contribute to the filed with rigor and creativity.</p>
